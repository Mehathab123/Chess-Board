This project showcases a responsive 8x8 chess board built entirely using HTML and CSS, leveraging the CSS Grid layout for precise alignment and simplicity.
The chess board features alternating light and dark squares, replicating the classic chess pattern.
This project serves as an excellent example of  visually appealing designs with pure HTML and CSS.
